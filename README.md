# The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model
represents a significant breakthrough in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond, thanks to its ability to generate human-like text based on the input it receives. Its architecture is based on the Transformer model, which allows it to effectively capture the context and semantics of the input text over long distances, making it particularly adept at tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and even complex reasoning tasks.

Here's a brief overview of the decoder-only architecture(like GPT) and steps you can follow to implement its components:

## 1. Understanding the Transformer Block

The core of the decoder-only architecture is the Transformer block, which consists of two main components: multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks. Each block applies these components in sequence, each followed by layer normalization and a residual connection.


*   **Multi-Head Self-Attention:** This mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different words in the input sequence differently, providing a dynamic way to aggregate context from the entire sequence.

*   **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks:** These are simple, fully connected neural networks applied to each position separately and identically. This means they look at each word (or token) in isolation and then transform it.

## 2. Understanding the whole architecture
To build a decode-only architecture, you would generally follow these steps:



*   **Embedding Layer:** This is where the model learns representations for each token in the vocabulary and for each possible position in the input sequence. The embeddings for tokens and their positions are summed to produce a single representation for each token that captures both its meaning and its position in the sequence.

*   **Stack of Transformer Blocks:** The heart of the model. Several Transformer blocks are stacked on top of each other to allow the model to learn complex relationships between tokens in the input sequence. Each block includes multi-head self-attention and feed-forward networks, as explained above.

*   **Output Layer:** After passing through the Transformer blocks, the output is normalized and then passed through a linear layer that projects it back to the size of the vocabulary. This produces a set of logits that can be used, with a softmax layer, to generate probabilities for each token in the vocabulary being the next token in the sequence.
